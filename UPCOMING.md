# Features


# Done

- In 3D, draw "downwards", i.e. the inner of the Mandelbrot set is at the top and the columns grow downward from there, giving it the appearance of a plateau
- Implement adaptive coloring as described in PLAN.md
- Implement a 3D export as a 3D model such that the scene can be used with Blender
- Save/Load view is probably not needed anymore
- In 3D export scene is not the same as the preview scene
